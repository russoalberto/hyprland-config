description: Target a git worktree - /worktree <branch> or off
---

Call the `worktree` tool with:
- `target`: $ARGUMENTS
- `workdir`: the current working directory (use the directory you are working in)

If no arguments provided, call `worktree` with no target to show current status.

Example: `worktree(target: "feature-branch", workdir: "/path/to/repo")`
